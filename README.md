# Botanist’s Typora theme
This is a theme for the software [Typora](https://typora.io), that copy the design of the doc of Botanist's Website.

The purpose of this theme is to edit the doc of [Botanist](https://github.com/adrienluitot/botanist-website), which is made using markdown, and to see the result in live without having to install the website in local.

Of course you can still use it for personal use if you like the theme.

## Give to Caesar what is Caesar‘s

For this theme as for the doc I use several things like fonts :

- [Open Sans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sans) for the normal texts
- [Anonymous Pro](https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro) for the `<pre>` elements
- [Hindi](https://github.com/itfoundry/hind) for the headings

For the code blocks, Typora uses [CodeMirror](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror) while I use [PrismJS](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) for the Botanist’s Website, so I decided to take the nearest theme from CodeMirror which is [Material Darker](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/master/theme/material-darker.css).

## How to install / use it

Typora already has a tutorial to install a theme that you can find [here](http://theme.typora.io/doc/Install-Theme/).

But in short you need to do this :

1. Clone this repo : `git clone https://github.com/adrienluitot/botanist-typora-theme.git`
2. Enter the `botanist-typora-theme` folder
3. Open the Typora’s themes folder. For this open Typora, click on `File` (top right of your window), then select `Preference...`, finally click on “Open Theme Folder”
4. Copy `botanist.css` and the folder `botanist` into the Typora’s themes folder.
5. Restart Typora

Once you installed it, you only need to select it in `Themes`.
